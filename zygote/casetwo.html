                    <h2>RWC approached me to start their online presence on the right foot. As a logistic start-up their customer service and prompt delivery set them apart from other local couriers. Business was growing and the owner knew if they wanted to grow even more, they would need an online presence.</h2>

                    <p>Through data analysis and user research, I was able to ascertain what a great courier website needs to do. As a B2C and B2B courier, visitors needed a clear division between services. Wanting to offer a true insight into what services RWC can provide, I had designed a website that funnels visitors into two categories: Residential Services or Commercial Services. The results were a 15% increase in quotes from both B2C and B2B businesses.</p>
                    <p>

                        A huge part of the redesign was geared around configuring the website from an SEO perspective. I wrote content specifically to earn key search positions and carry out deep technical optimization. The results have been staggering. I continue to work closely with the team at RWC Delivery, helping them grow the brand.</p>
